I spent about 6 hours on this lab. I think that this lab was much easier than lab 3, since I now have an extremely deep understanding of pointers, structs, etc. Creating the terse linked list was a fun challenge to take on, and seeing the pool simulation fully complete with code I developed was satisfying.

NOTE:
Run "make lab4" to build the lab ("make lab4u" to build the unreliable version), "make prototypes" to build all prototypes, and "make clean" to get rid of unneeded .o files. I added all of these to the all target to make it easier.
