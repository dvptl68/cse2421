THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 6.

BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE PERFORMED ALL OF THE WORK TO DETERMINE THE ANSWERS FOUND WITHIN THIS FILE MYSELF WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM ANY PERSON OTHER THAN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THIS COURSE OR ONE OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE GRADERS.

I spent about 5 hours working on this lab - and now I believe I understand almost everything that we have learned in class.
This submission is my third submission, and includes register improvements. I made changes so count and search both use less registers than before.
